/r/wallstreetsbets scraper for live data.

This uses praw (a reddit API wrapper) to grab the most recent 100 posts and most recent 1000 comments from /r/wallstreetbets. It checks the timestamp of those posts and comments and processes those that are between five minutes and ten minutes old. If a submission has more than one comment, and those comments have a score (upvote vs downvote) of more than zero, they are run through a word parser to look for stock tickers. Those comments are also run through vaderSentiment (created by CJ Hutto and then further editted by Ryan Elliot) to give them a "sentiment score." All of this is sent to a mongoDB database to eventually be pulled and displayed on wsb-data.vercel.app.
